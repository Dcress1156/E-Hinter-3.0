Should work flawlessly. There may be a crash here and there when copying the text, but other than that the program should function with no hitches.

Made with C++/CLI. Why? Because I guess I am a caveman. This probably won't ever be made in any other language because C++ and C are the only languages where I can comfortably work with strings. I attempted an updated version in Rust, but strings in Rust give me migraines, so that probably won't happen. 

It was fine in Python but (slow). Also not fiddling with C#, because Visual Studio is a bloated mess.
